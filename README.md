# STEP RACE GAME
---

This is a mini game that implements snakes and ladders mechanism where your player roll the dice to step forward until finish.

The only difference is that the layout of this game using horizontal plane, traps and some powerups rather than using snakes and ladders for random events.

The reason why we use Java

- It's Object Oriented-based
- Easy to Learn for Compiled Resources
- Of Course, for our end-semester's project ✨

Features :

- Dice movement based-game.
- 3 Kinds of Power UPs with each has their own ability.
- Traps, Power ups, and Object tiles are randomized.
- Animated idling and movement on character.
- Some bugs that we don't have time to fix it.

Enjoy!

## Misc

This game implemented Java FX libraries which gives us a lot of UI nodes option to use.
Engine using thread with Java FX implemented methods to override the limitation of non-Java FX
libraries usage (in this case : Thread objects).

- Special Thanks to our adjunct professors (Mr. Max & Ms. Cecillia) to spare their limited time and sweat for giving this invaluable subject (Java Object Oriented-Programming).
